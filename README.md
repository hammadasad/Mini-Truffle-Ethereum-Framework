This mini framework was built to compile, test and deploy Ethereum smart contracts and to learn the inner workings of how a framework like Truffle would work.

To use:
  - Need the Metamask browser extension and an account on the Rinkbey(or whichever) network
  - Need the 12 word mnemonic of your account
  - Need to sign up for an account on Infura (it's free)
  - Need to replace the corresponding info in the deploy.js to match your account details
  - Need Node.js (I used v9.10.1)
  - You can write up your own contract in Solidity

- Write corresponding unit tests in the unit test file (Inbox.test.js)

- Choose which network you're deploying to through Infura

- Copy & Paste your Solidity contract into Remix, put your account details and interact with it.

- Warning: Costs Gas AKA money
